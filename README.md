#** Module One Final Project Guide **

# ~ Welcome to the Joke Generator! ~

This program will generate random jokes for the user!

## Install Instructions

- Fork and clone the repository at "https://github.com/caffiendkitten/module-one-final-project-guidelines-seattle-web-051319"

- cd into the correct directory, after opening the file, we suggest deleting the 'development.db' (if it exists) file in the event the database is skewed from cloning.

- after deleting the database, re-seed the database by first running 'db:migrate' in your terminal to make sure the database is structured correctly.

- once the migration files are in order, run 'db:seed' in your terminal to repopulate the database.

- to run the program, enter 'rake run' in your console to begin the game!
