## Install Instructions

1. Fork and clone the repository at "https://github.com/caffiendkitten/module-one-final-project-guidelines-seattle-web-051319"

2. `cd` into the correct directory, after opening the file, we suggest deleting the 'development.db' (if it exists) file in the event the database is skewed from cloning.

3. After deleting the database, re-seed the database by first running `db:migrate` in your terminal to make sure the database is structured correctly.

4. Once the migration files are in order, run `db:seed` in your terminal to repopulate the database.

5. To run the program, enter `rake run` in your console to begin the game!
